# Pattern Detection and Recognition using Deep Learning

This repository holds code for our project ***Pattern Detection and Recognition using Deep Learning***

By Manasi Khapke, Shraddha Gunjal, Faizan Shaikh

## Introduction

Our main objective of doing this project is to understand the working of Deep Neural Networks, more specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for computer vision and use them to solve real world problems.

We demonstrate the use of CNN for two tasks, Detection and Recognition
