# Project on Pattern Detection and Recognition using Deep Learning

By Manasi Khapke, Shraddha Gunjal, Faizan Shaikh

## Introduction

Our main objective of doing this project is to understand the Deep Learning, more specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for computer vision and use them to solve real world problems.

We demonstrate the use of CNN for two tasks, Detection and Recognition.
